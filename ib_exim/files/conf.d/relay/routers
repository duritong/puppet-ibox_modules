# The following router chain follows the idea posted on
# http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/README.exim_v4_app2
#
# In detail this means, we
# 1st) validate the recipient by runninng verify only routers
# 2nd) reject address via failed_address_router if address can't be verified
# 3rd) check for spam and/or viri via amavis
# 4th) deliver the mail to the real routers.

## ATTENTION: if you change/add/remove a router, you should always also remove
##            the corresponding validation router. All validation routers are
##            named with the check_ prefix.

# A description for each router can be found in the "real" router section

## <validation>
