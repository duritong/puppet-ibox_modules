# This setting, if uncommented, allows users to authenticate using
# their system passwords against saslauthd if they connect over a
# secure connection. If you have network logins such as NIS or
# Kerberos rather than only local users, then you possibly also want
# to configure /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd to use the 'pam' mechanism
# too. Once a user is authenticated, the acl_check_rcpt ACL then
# allows them to relay through the system.

# Comment this one out if you uncomment the above. Did you make sure
# saslauthd is actually running first?
