# The next three settings create two lists of domains and one list of hosts.
# These lists are referred to later in this configuration using the syntax
# +local_domains, +relay_to_domains, and +relay_from_hosts, respectively. They
# are all colon-separated lists:

domainlist local_domains = @ : localhost : localhost.localdomain
domainlist relay_to_domains =
hostlist   relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1

# Most straightforward access control requirements can be obtained by
# appropriate settings of the above options. In more complicated situations,
# you may need to modify the Access Control Lists (ACLs) which appear later in
# this file.

# The first setting specifies your local domains, for example:
#
#   domainlist local_domains = my.first.domain : my.second.domain
#
# You can use "@" to mean "the name of the local host", as in the default
# setting above. This is the name that is specified by primary_hostname,
# as specified above (or defaulted). If you do not want to do any local
# deliveries, remove the "@" from the setting above. If you want to accept mail
# addressed to your host's literal IP address, for example, mail addressed to
# "user@[192.168.23.44]", you can add "@[]" as an item in the local domains
# list. You also need to uncomment "allow_domain_literals" below. This is not
# recommended for today's Internet.

# The second setting specifies domains for which your host is an incoming relay.
# If you are not doing any relaying, you should leave the list empty. However,
# if your host is an MX backup or gateway of some kind for some domains, you
# must set relay_to_domains to match those domains. For example:
#
# domainlist relay_to_domains = *.myco.com : my.friend.org
#
# This will allow any host to relay through your host to those domains.
# See the section of the manual entitled "Control of relaying" for more
# information.

# The third setting specifies hosts that can use your host as an outgoing relay
# to any other host on the Internet. Such a setting commonly refers to a
# complete local network as well as the localhost. For example:
#
# hostlist relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1 : 192.168.0.0/16
#
# The "/16" is a bit mask (CIDR notation), not a number of hosts. Note that you
# have to include 127.0.0.1 if you want to allow processes on your host to send
# SMTP mail by using the loopback address. A number of MUAs use this method of
# sending mail.
